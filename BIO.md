*IT Solutions Delivery Lead | Senior Staff Engineer | ADHD Advocate*

> *With nearly three decades in tech, I’ve navigated the full stack—from hardware and firmware to middleware, DevOps, and user experience. As a recognized “gray hat” engineer, I’ve led cross-functional teams, mentored emerging talent, and architected solutions that balance innovation with integrity.*

***Here’s the twist:*** I’m also ADHD. Most days, I’m steering the ship. On others, I’m wrestling the current. But through it all, I’ve built a career grounded in resilience, empathy, and technical excellence.

In my current role as an IT Solutions Delivery Lead, I bridge the gap between business vision and technical execution. I champion human-centered design and customer-first thinking, delivering solutions that don’t just work—they resonate. My mission is to craft experiences that delight users, elevate brands, and drive meaningful impact.

As I look ahead, I’m excited to keep blending deep technical expertise with lived neurodivergent insight—building systems that are not only smart, but also deeply human.
