*Senior Staff Engineer | Technical Leader | ADHD Advocate*

> *With nearly three decades in the tech arena, I've mastered the intricacies of hardware, delved into the depths of software, and conquered the challenges of middleware, operations, and DevOps. Recognized as a 'gray hat' engineer, I've led diverse teams and mentored rising stars.*

***But here's the twist:** I'm also ADHD. Nine days out of ten, I'm calling the shots, but on that rare day, it's got me in its grip.*

*Yet, amidst the chaos, I've honed a path of integrity, reliability, and excellence. As a seasoned staff engineer, I've cultivated cultures of innovation and collaboration, shaping products that dazzle users and surpass expectations.*

*Driven by a fervor for human-centered design and customer-centricity, I craft solutions that aren't just cutting-edgeâ€”they're emotionally resonant, enhancing user journeys and driving brand loyalty.*

*As I embark on fresh ventures, I'm poised to merge technical prowess with empathetic insights, delivering solutions that not only wow on a technical level but also win hearts and minds.*
